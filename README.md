=============================

This is a simple game of snake using PyGame. The purpose of the project is not

Git Workshop organized at the Ostschweizer Fachhochschule in Rapperswil.

How to run
----------

To run the game you need python 3.9 or higher and `pygame`, optionally you can
use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Without
poetry you can use a simmple a virtual environment
